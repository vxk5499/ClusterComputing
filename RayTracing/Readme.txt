Ray tracing is an image rendering technique in which all the pixels in the rendered image can be rendered independent of each other. It is to be noted that there may be millions of pixels in a rendered image. Each requiring its own ray tracing result. If the scenes captured are reflective or transparent, large number of rays are generated and traced, thus leading to large execution time. A sequential program thus would take large amount of execution time.
Here since each pixel is rendered independently, the program can be parallelized to run on a number of processors, thus leading to the faster execution times. The parallelization is done by using static partitioning that include strips, square blocks, cyclical assignment of rows and also by dynamic portioning using a centralized task queue. The various design methodology are described in the later sections.

Static partitioning using contiguous strips of columns:
In this the scene is divided into a number of vertical strips depending on the number of processors. Each strip is processed by a single processor. In certain cases the scene cannot be exactly divided among the processors, it results in the remainder portion. The remainder portion is processed by the master in these cases. Once the required portions of the image are processed by the slaves, the values obtained are passed to the master. The master places all the values in the respective positions in the array and thus the required image is obtained.
Static partitioning using square blocks:
In this the whole scene is divided into a number of square blocks equal to the number of processors, thus, each block is processed by a single processor. In certain cases remainder can occur on the top and right side of the scene, these extra pixels are processed by the processor handling the block right next to the remainder. This shows that remainder is also almost divided among processors. Once the required portions of the image are processed by the slaves, the values obtained are passed to the master. The master places all the values in the respective positions in the array and thus the required image is obtained.
Static partitioning using cyclical assignment of rows:
In this the whole scene is portioned into a number of strips assigned to each processor in a cyclic manner till the whole scene is rendered. In certain cases the scene cannot be exactly divided among the processors, the remaining strips are processed by the master in these cases. Once the required portions of the image are processed by the slaves, the values obtained are passed to the master. The master places all the values in the respective positions in the array and thus the required image is obtained.
